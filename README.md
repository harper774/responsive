# responsive

In this project

I use Bootstrap to make my portfolio responsive to different sizes of screen

and in this way enables its responsiveness in different devices.

I use the following components from bootstrap:

container-fluid & row & col,
navs & nav-item & nav link,
card & card-body & card-text,
bg-dark, text-white, 
card-img, card-img-overlay,
form-group & form-control,
btn & btn-secondary
